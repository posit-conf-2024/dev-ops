# Activity 1

## Fork repository

Fork the Posit Conf 2024 Dev-Ops workshop Github
[repository](https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/dev-ops) onto your local
machine as a reference guide.

![](images/forkrepo.png)

Grab the https url of your forked repo and `git clone` it somewhere on
your computer. You will be using this repo primarily for resources and
instructions.

## Open a code editor

Throughout this workshop we will be writing code in both R and Python.
We will be starting with a python model so you will need to use an IDE
with a Python interpretor.

Open up a vscode session in your [Workbench environment]{.underline} or
a local python code editor of your choice. If using your local machine
make sure that you have Python
[installed](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and on
[PATH](https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/). This is a [good
article](https://chendaniely.github.io/python_setup/) on best practices
for setting up Python using Pyenv.

## Initialize a new git repository

Open your vscode terminal (Control + dash for quick open) and create a
folder where you'll be saving all of your classwork for this workshop.
Call it something like`devops_classwork`. See the code example below for
changing into my Desktop directory, creating a folder, and then changing
the directory into that folder.

```         
cd /Users/rikagorn/Desktop
mkdir devops_classwork
cd devops_classword
```

Initialize git in your folder.

```         
git init
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Create some code content

We will be creating three different files. Copy the code from the
Dev-ops repo.

1\. `README.md` - a markdown file used for documentation

2\. `model_pthon.py` - a python file with a linear regression model

3\. `r_eda.R` - an R file with some exploratory data analysis

## Add and commit your code locally

```         
git add README.md
git add model_python.py
git add r_eda.r
git status
git commit -m "model and readme added"
```

## Push local repo to remote github repo

Create a remote repository on github.com and call it something like
`devops-classwork`.

Go back to your local repo and add the remote upstream github repo.

```         
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rikagx/devops-classwork.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Create a branch and merge new file

```         
git checkout -b yourname/small-edits
touch .gitignore # this creates a file called .gitignore
```

Add these [python specific
files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore)
and these [r specific
files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/R.gitignore) to
your .gitignore file

```         
git add .gitignore
git commit "added .gitignore"
git push origin yourname/small-edits
git checkout main
git merge yourname/small-edits
git push
```

# Activity 2

## Create a virtual environment

Create a new branch for the following exercises:

`git checkout -b yourname/venv-renv`

::: panel-tabset
### R

Open the r_eda.R file that you created above.

Install `renv` with `install.packages("renv")`

```{r}
# library path without renv initialized.
.libPaths()
lapply(.libPaths(), list.files)

renv::init()

# library path with renv initialized.
.libPaths()
lapply(.libPaths(), list.files)

```

### Python

Open the model_python.py file that you created above. Type 'python' into
your terminal to start an executable. You should see like the below
output:

Python 3.12.0 (main, Jun 12 2024, 14:00:16) \[Clang 15.0.0
(clang-1500.3.9.4)\] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or
"license" for more information.

\>\>\> \[Type the below code here\]

\>\>\> exit()

```{python}
# library path without venv initialized
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

```{bash}
# run in your bash terminal
pip list
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip list
```

```{python}
# library path with venv initialized
import sys
print(sys.path)
```
:::

## Snapshot your code

::: panel-tabset
### R

Take a look at the renv.lock file before and after you snapshot your
code. Install the following packages:

`install.packages(c("palmerpenguins", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))`.

Feel free to run your R code which is reproduced below and see the
output of your analysis.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

df <- palmerpenguins::penguins

table1 <- df %>%
  group_by(species, sex) %>%
  summarise(
    across(
      where(is.numeric), 
      \(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
      )
    ) %>%
  knitr::kable()

## Penguin Size vs Mass by Species


plot <- df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Snapshot your code with `renv::snapshot()`.

### Python

```{bash}
# run in your bash terminal
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install palmerpenguins
pip install duckdb
pip install scikit-learn
```

Run your model_python.py in the terminal with `python model_python.py`.
The model code is reproduced below with some additional print
statements.

```{python}
import duckdb
from palmerpenguins import penguins
from pandas import get_dummies
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

con = duckdb.connect("my-db.duckdb")
df = penguins.load_penguins()
df = con.execute("SELECT * FROM df").fetchdf().dropna()
con.close()

df.head(3)

X = get_dummies(df[["bill_length_mm", "species", "sex"]], drop_first=True)
y = df["body_mass_g"]

model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

print(f"R^2 {model.score(X,y)}")
print(f"Intercept {model.intercept_}")
print(f"Columns {X.columns}")
print(f"Coefficients {model.coef_}")

```

Freeze your pip installed packages in a requirements.txt file. You
should do this every time you install additional packages or modules.

```{bash}
# run in bash terminal

pip list > requirements.txt
pip list

```
:::

## Add, commit, push your code

```         
# run in your bash terminal

git add readme.md
git add r_eda.r
git add model_python.py
git commit -m "creating virtual environments"
git push origin yourname/venv-renv
git checkout main
git merge yourname/venv-renv
git push
```

# Activity 3

## Create github actions

Go to `Actions` in your github repository and enable github actions.

![](images/actions.png)

Github action MUST be created as a .yaml file in the following directory
structure:

```         
mkdir .github
cd .github/
mkdir workflows
cd workflows/
touch .yaml
```

Copy the
\[following(https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart)\]
into your yaml file and then add, commit, and push your code to main.
You can try pushing from a branch or straight from main.

```{yaml}
name: GitHub Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is testing out GitHub Actions 🚀
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

Visit the Actions tab of your repo to see if the Action succeeded.

# Activity 4

## Pre-commit hooks

```{bash}
# run in your bash terminal
pip install pre-commit
pip install black
```

Create a file called .pre-commit.config.yaml and add the following

```{bash}
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black-pre-commit-mirror
    rev: 23.10.1
    hooks:
    - id: black
    language_version: python3.12
```

```{bash}
# run in your bash terminal
pre-commit install
```

Stage and commit your code and fix any errors that the hooks identify.
Try adding some other hooks that look interesting:

-   https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/precommit/articles/available-hooks.html
-   https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks

# Activity 5

## Docker Run

The basic docker run command takes this form:

`docker run [OPTIONS] [IMAGE:TAG] [COMMAND] [ARG...]`

In the below exercise we will practice running docker containers with
different options or “flags.”

1.  Currently we have no docker images downloaded. Confirm this with
    `docker image ls -a.`

2.  Pull down a Dockerhub linux image. Confirm that the image is
    downloaded with the ls command. `docker pull ubuntu`
    `docker image ls -a`

3.  Run an interactive container with the bash shell attached. Run a few
    linux commands to explore your environment and then exit the
    container.

```{bash}
sudo docker run -it ubuntu bash
ls
whoami
hostname
```

Exit the container with Ctrl+D or exit. This docker command runs the
container in the foreground so you are unable to access the command
prompt for your original alpine server. For this reason interactive mode
is often used for development and testing.

Run the container in detached mode and then list all your containers and
check your processes. Stop the container using its name or ID.

```{bash}
docker run -d ubuntu
docker container ls -a
docker ps -a 
docker container stop [name_of_container]

```

You should see that the ubuntu container was created and then exited.
The container ID is shown with an exited status and the command line is
still accessible.

Detached containers run in the background, so the container keeps
running until the application process exits (which is what happened
here), or you stop the container. For this reason detached mode is often
used for production purposes.

# Activity 6

## Debugging Containers

The docker exec command is very similar to the docker run -it command.
Both are very helpful for debugging containers as they allow you to jump
inside your container instance. The exec command needs a running
container to execute any command, whereas the -it flag starts a
container and places you into a terminal in interactive mode. Use the
docker exec command to execute a bash command in a running container.
This can be used to execute any command within a running container.

Be careful not use docker exec to change your container as once it is
deleted you will lose any changes you’ve made!

docker exec requires two arguments - the container and the command you
want to run.

docker exec \[OPTIONS\] CONTAINER \[COMMAND\] \[ARG...\] Use docker run
-it to jump into an ubuntu container. `docker run -it ubuntu` `exit` Use
docker exec to run commands in a container

```         
docker container ls -a # to get a container ID of a running container
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
exit
docker exec CONTAINER_ID ls
```

Lets run a detached MySQL container and then check out some logs. The
database requires a password to work. In production you should never
pass credentials directly in your command but we will do it for testing
purposes. (The forward slashes below allow you to use a new line for
your code)

```         
 docker container run -d --name mydb \
 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \ 
 mysql
 
docker container logs mydb
```

### Mapping Ports

Pull two versions of the same image

```         
docker pull httpd:alpine
docker pull httpd:latest
# Inspect ports.
docker inspect  httpd:latest
docker inspect  httpd:alpine
# Map two different host ports to the same application port for the two containers.
docker run -d -p 3456:80 --name httpd-latest httpd:latest
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name httpd-alpine httpd:alpine
docker ps
```

### Mounting Data

In order to get data in or out of a container, you need to mount a
shared volume (directory) between the container and host with the -v
flag. You specify a host directory and a container directory separated
by :. Anything in the volume will be available to both the host and the
container at the file paths specified.

Stop your running containers with docker stop and return to your
original command prompt. Create a text file.

```         
# create a text file
touch test.txt 

 # redirect string to the file
echo "this is a test file" > test.txt

# confirm that the echo command worked and gets its directory path
cat test.txt 
pwd

# mount a shared volume to a folder in the container called "data"
docker run -it -d -v /root:/data ubuntu 
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash

# see what folders are in the container
ls 

# move to the newly created data directory
cd data 

# confirm that the text file is there
ls 
```

## Create a FastAPI using our penguin model

::: callout-note
This code was tested using Python 3.11.4.
:::

Create and activate a virtual environment.

```         
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

Create 3 files

`model.py` - our linear regression model file

```         
"""
This script creates a linear regression model
to predict the body mass of palmer penguins
given their sex, species, and bill length in mm

"""
import joblib
import duckdb
from palmerpenguins import penguins
from pandas import get_dummies
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

con = duckdb.connect("my-db.duckdb")
df = penguins.load_penguins()
df = con.execute("SELECT * FROM df").fetchdf().dropna()
con.close()

df.head(3)

X = get_dummies(df[["bill_length_mm", "species", "sex"]], drop_first=True)
y = df["body_mass_g"]

model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
joblib.dump(model, 'penguin_model.joblib')
```

`main.py` - our prediction fastapi

```         
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('penguin_model.joblib')

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Define the request body
class PenguinFeatures(BaseModel):
    species: str
    sex: str
    bill_length_mm: float

# Define the endpoint for prediction
@app.post("/predict")
def predict(features: PenguinFeatures):
    # Map species and sex to the appropriate format used in training
    species_map = {"Adelie": 0, "Chinstrap": 1, "Gentoo": 2}
    sex_map = {"male": 0, "female": 1}

    try:
        species = species_map[features.species]
        sex = sex_map[features.sex]
    except KeyError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid species or sex")

    # Prepare the input data for the model
    input_data = pd.DataFrame([{
        "bill_length_mm": features.bill_length_mm,
        "species_Chinstrap": 1 if features.species == "Chinstrap" else 0,
        "species_Gentoo": 1 if features.species == "Gentoo" else 0,
        "sex_male": 1 if features.sex == "male" else 0,
    }])

    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)[0]

    # Return the prediction
    return {"body_mass_g": prediction}
```

Install our requirements file

```         
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Login to your server environment and click on the Connect widget.

![](images/connect-widget.png)

Start the Automated Stock report jumpstart example. Click through until
you get to Step 5 and then copy the url. This is the url for your
Connect server. Close out of the jumpstart example.

![](images/server-url.png)

Click on your name \> API Keys tab. Create an API key and note it down
somewhere safe.

![](images/api-tab.png)

Jump back to your vscode virtual environment and add your server url and
api key to the rsconnect-python CLI.

To add a server, you need the following:

1.  Your server URL
2.  Your API key. See the [API
    Keys](https://docs.posit.co/connect/user/api-keys/) section.
3.  A nickname for the server that you provide

```         
pip install rsconnect-python
rsconnect add \
    --server https://my.connect.server/ \
    --name myServer \
    --api-key $CONNECT_API_KEY
```

Deploy our FastAPI to the Connect server.

```         
rsconnect deploy fastapi \
    -n myServer \
    --entrypoint main:app \
    ./
```

Test the API in your terminal

```         
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://granite-mole.fd049.fleeting.rstd.io/rsconnect/content/e444fd65-634f-4b6a-bc78-be70c790cc3f/predict' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "species": "Adelie",
  "sex": "female",
  "bill_length_mm": 40.0
}'
```

Fix the authorization error by passing in your API key.

```         
export CONNECT_API_KEY=So4JUDFJ01mziHx2QudAw9iUJt2z0Ylj

curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://granite-mole.fd049.fleeting.rstd.io/rsconnect/content/e444fd65-634f-4b6a-bc78-be70c790cc3f/predict' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Key ${CONNECT_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
  "species": "Adelie",
  "sex": "female",
  "bill_length_mm": 40.0
}'
```

## Create a Shiny UI for the prediction API

Open an Rstudio IDE session and create a shiny app file called `app.R`.
Add your API key to your .Renviron file. You can do this easily using
the usethis package: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

app.R

```         
library(shiny)
library(httr2)

# Correct API URL
api_url <- "https://granite-mole.fd049.fleeting.rstd.io/rsconnect/content/e444fd65-634f-4b6a-bc78-be70c790cc3f/predict"

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Penguin Mass Predictor"),
  
  # Model input values
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput(
        "bill_length",
        "Bill Length (mm)",
        min = 30,
        max = 60,
        value = 45,
        step = 0.1
      ),
      selectInput(
        "sex",
        "Sex",
        c("male", "female") # Ensure values match what FastAPI expects
      ),
      selectInput(
        "species",
        "Species",
        c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo")
      ),
      # Get model predictions
      actionButton(
        "predict",
        "Predict"
      )
    ),
    
    mainPanel(
      h2("Penguin Parameters"),
      verbatimTextOutput("vals"),
      h2("Predicted Penguin Mass (g)"),
      textOutput("pred")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  # Input params
  vals <- reactive(
    list(
      bill_length_mm = input$bill_length,
      species = input$species, # Send the species directly
      sex = tolower(input$sex) # Ensure "male" and "female" are lowercase
    )
  )
  
  # Fetch prediction from API
  pred <- eventReactive(
    input$predict,
    {
      req <- httr2::request(api_url) |>
        httr2::req_body_json(vals()) |>
        httr2::req_headers(
          "Content-Type" = "application/json",
          "Authorization" = paste("Bearer", Sys.getenv("key")) # Add API key to headers
        ) |>
        httr2::req_perform()
      
      httr2::resp_body_json(req)
    },
    ignoreInit = TRUE
  )
  
  
  # Render to UI
  output$pred <- renderText(pred()$body_mass_g)
  output$vals <- renderPrint(vals())
}

# Run the application
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
